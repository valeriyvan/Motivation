# Motivation

Motivation is a Mac OS X screen saver inspired by [Alex MacCaw](https://twitter.com/maccaw)'s [Motivation Chrome Extension](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/life-hacks). From Alex:

> …screen with a counter showing your age incrementing in real time… It’s a simple tool, but it helps me think about perspective a bit more, which in turn helps me optimize my time.

You can configure your age once you picked it in Screen Saver Preferences in System Preferences.

## Building

Latest version of Xcode 8 is required to build Motivation since it's written in Swift 3.

All credits go to original author [Sam Soffes](https://github.com/soffes/Motivation). Since Sam doesn't accept pull requests for quite long time I have merged my addition, option to set birth time, into master and make this release available.
